#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration Based on =use-package=

* Introduction
Motivational points:
  - Everything, including customization modules, is loaded using
    =use-package=. Because =use-package= wasn't a part of Emacs until
    24.5 this configuration /as is/ is not working with 24.4. However
    it could be easily modified by just installing =use-package= via
    ELPA at the beginning.
  - Having configuration in =Emacs-Lisp=. I used to have literate
    programming style configuration using =org-babel=, but seems like
    complications: tricky navigation, swithing to source editing and
    back, reloading issues, performance hit outweigh the benefit of
    having a good documentation and code visibility manager.

Since configuration is changing all the time, there's no point to
describe it at length. Just some of the highlights.

* Some Packages/Tools

  * =ag= - I use my own custom =ag.el= because I need it to work on Windows
  * =browse-kill-ring=
  * =undo-tree=
  * =ace-window=
  * =ace-jump=
  * =ido= including =ido-ubiquitous= and =flx-ido=
  * =hide-lines=
  * =projectile= and =find-file-in-project=
  * =company=
  * =flycheck=
  * =paredit=
  * Python programming: =python-mode=, =anaconda=
  * C/C++: =cc-mode=, =c-company-headers=, =c-eldoc=
  * Javascript via =js-2=, =tern=, =mocha=, =js-comint=
  * Docker: =dockerfile-mode=, =yaml= and =docker=

* Some Shortcuts

** Help

   * =C-h M-k= describe keymap
   * =C-h C-c= describe character at point
   * =C-h C-b= describes keys customizations

** Some Useful Keymaps

 These could be explored further via =C-h M-k= for example

   * =C-x f= file opening map
   * =C-x t= toggling keymap
   * =C-x w= windows management keymap
   * =C-z= personal keymap

** Buffer Visibility / Navigation
   * =C-z /= changes visibility via =hide-lines=
   * =M-s o= shows occurences of a string in a buffer (=occur=)
   * =M-s O= multi buffer occur (moccur)
   * =M-g j= starts =avy-jump=

** Miscellaneous
   * =C-x K= kill this buffer
   * =C-M-:= start/switch to IELM with current buffer
   * =M-z= is zapping up to a character, =M-Z= zaps to character. Zapping backward is via negative universal argument.

* Using outline
** DONE Faces for outline headers
** DONE use outshine speedy
** TODO configure better keys like M-left, M-right, etc.
** TODO Configure folds
    
* TODO Add ripgrep via deadgrep to M-s search keymap

* DONE Move all the parts configuration ffe-* files to init.el once outline is used

* TODO Heavy configuration parts can go to *-plus packages
