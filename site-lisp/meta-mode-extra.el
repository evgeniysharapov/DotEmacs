;; Author: Evgeniy Sharapov <evgeniy.sharapov@gmail.com>
;; Keywords: metapost


;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides functionality that I find useful while editing ConTeXt files.
;; Following features are implemented:
;; - preview of the metapost code in the document
;; - preview of the metapost code in a separate window

;;; Code:
(require 'doc-view)
(provide 'meta-mode-extra)
;;; meta-mode-extra.el ends here
